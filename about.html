	<p>Hello, my name is Justin (jcat1214) and I'm excited to learn what it takes to become a professional web developer. In my free time I enjoy listening to music,
	   watching movies, reading books, playing video games, taking walks, and drinking coffee and tea.  <strong><a href="subscribe.html">Subscribe</a></strong> to join me on this crazy adventure.<br><br>&ndash;Justin</p>

	<p>P.S. Don't give up on your own adventure. Before you go, please pet my sleeping kitties with your cursor.</p>
